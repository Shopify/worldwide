# The only flag with official standing in Martinique is the French flag.
# The emoji flag sequence MQ renders as the "snake flag", which is resented by some as a symbol
# of the slave trade.  A new local flag, the IsÃ©itÃ© flag, was brought into use in 2019, but 
# revoked in 2021.  At this point, the safest course of action seems to be to use the French flag.
