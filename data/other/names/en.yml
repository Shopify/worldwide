    # The culturally appropriate casual way to refer to someone's name
    # Say, for example, your customer has the given name "Ken" and surname "Tanaka".
    # In English, you'd want to say something like "Hello, Ken," but in Japanese
    # that would be considered overly familiar (to the point that it would cause offence),
    # so the appropriate greeting would be "Hello, Tanaka-sama."
    # This key is the culturally-appropriate equivalent of "Ken".
    greeting: "%{given}"
    # This is both the given and surnames, arranging them in the culturally-appropriate order.
    # Say, for example, your customer has the given name "Ken" and surname "Tanaka".
    # In Japanese, this would be "TanakaKen-sama" (note there is no space),
    # but in English it would be "Ken Tanaka".
    full: "%{given} %{surname}"
