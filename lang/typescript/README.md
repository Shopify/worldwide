# Worldwide - Typescript

ğŸš§ Still in development -- not ready for use yet ğŸš§

## Contributing & Development

### Setup

We use Yarn for dependency management. To setup run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Build

To run a build run:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will use Rollup to generate `dist/`, which is our bundled JS package.
