      # Although the requirement of only using translations with draft status 'Contributed'
      # and above was introduced, many locales have their currency formatting under draft status
      # 'Provisional'. Using these are more consistent with the locale than using 'root' data.
      #
      # The patches below were automatically generated by selecting locales with the following:
      # 1. The provisional currency formatting pattern includes the decimal formatting pattern for that locale and amount
      # 2. The provisional currency formatting pattern exists but there is no decimal formatting pattern for that locale and amount
